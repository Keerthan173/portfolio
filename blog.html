  <h2>UHV – Definitiveness of Ethical Human Conduct</h2>
  <p>
    Ethical human conduct is not just a desirable behavior—it is the foundation of a harmonious society. In the context of Universal Human Values, the <strong>definitiveness</strong> of ethical conduct means that such behavior is not random, vague, or based on opinion, but rather universal, clear, and rooted in human nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every human being aspires for trust, respect, happiness, and peaceful coexistence. These are not cultural preferences but shared human values. Therefore, the values that guide our conduct must also be <em>definite</em>—meaning they can be understood logically, accepted universally, and practiced consistently.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ethical conduct is defined by qualities such as honesty, responsibility, compassion, and justice. These values remain the same regardless of place, time, or background. For instance, truthfulness is appreciated whether you are in a classroom, workplace, or at home. Its value does not change with situations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of understanding definitiveness in human conduct is not just to follow rules, but to develop clarity within ourselves. Once we clearly understand what is right, we naturally feel committed to doing what is right. This clarity leads to integrity, where our thoughts, words, and actions are in alignment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, ethical conduct is not enforced from outside—it grows from a deep inner understanding of what it means to be human. The more definite and clear this understanding is, the more naturally we live in harmony with ourselves and others.
